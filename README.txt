This website was built to advertise pinball repair and service.
I used Jquery to create a carosuel for a pinball machine that is being restored on the main page. 
You will notice by clicking on either the left or right sides of the pictures, the image will advance or reverse the images.
I have used CSS to change the background color and the font for the entire website.
To run this web application, double click the index file found in the root folder. Your default browser will open and you will see my website.
