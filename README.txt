This website was built to advertise pinball repair and service.
I used Jquery to create a carosuel for a pinball machine that is being restored on the main page. 
By clicking on either the left or right sides of the images, the image will advance or reverse the current image.
I have used CSS to change the background color and the font for the entire website.
To run this web application, double click the index file found in the root folder. Your default browser will open and you will see my website.
